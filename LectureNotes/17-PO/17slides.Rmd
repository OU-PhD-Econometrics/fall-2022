# Plan for the Day

1. What are potential outcomes? What are treatment effects?

2. Challenges to identifying treatment effects

3. Matching & IV

4. Control functions

---
# Potential Outcomes model

- Developed by `r Citet(biblio,"quandt1958")` and `r Citet(biblio,"rubin1974")`

- Two potential outcomes, $(Y_0,Y_1)$, associated with each treatment status $D\in\{0,1\}$

- The econometrician only observes:
    - the treatment dummy $D$
    - the realized outcome $Y=D Y_1 + (1-D)Y_0$

- Note: we could have more than two treatments

- Note: we also assume .hi[SUTVA]: $i$'s treatment doesn't affect $j$'s outcome
    - SUTVA also known as "no interference" in Judea Pearl's world

---
# Objects of interest

Individual-level Treatment Effects: 

- $Y_{i1} - Y_{i0},\,\,\,\, i=1,\ldots,N$

Mean treatment effect parameters:

- .hi[Average Treatment Effect (ATE):] $\mathbb{E}(Y_1-Y_0)$

- .hi[Average Treatment on the Treated (ATT):] $\mathbb{E}(Y_1-Y_0|D=1)$

- .hi[Average Treatment on the Untreated (ATU):] $\mathbb{E}(Y_1-Y_0|D=0)$
 
- No covariates in this simple setting, but we could include them fairly easily

---
# Objects of interest (Continued)

- Each treatment parameter answers a different question

- ATT is most related to the effectiveness of an existing program 

    - ATT does not account for program's cost

- We can define many other relevant treatment effect parameters:

    - Marginal Treatment Effect
    
    - Policy Relevant Treatment Effect
    
- These require imposing some structure on the underlying selection model 



---
# Identification challenges
Two main problems arise when identifying the effect of treatment $D$ on outcome $Y$: 

1. .hi[Evaluation problem:] for each $i$ we only observe either $Y_0$ or $Y_1$, but never both

2. .hi[Selection problem:] selection into treatment is endogenous, i.e. $(Y_0,Y_1) \not \perp D$


---
# The evaluation problem

- Fundamental observability problem $\implies$ individual TE $Y_{i1} - Y_{i0}$ is not identified

- Thus, we often focus on mean treatment effects, such as the ATE, ATT, ATU 

- Or on other parameters that depend on the marginal distributions only; e.g. QTE

- Suppose individuals were randomly assigned across treatment and control groups: 
\begin{align*}
ATE&=\mathbb{E}(Y_1-Y_0)\\
&=\mathbb{E}(Y_1|D=1) - \mathbb{E}(Y_0|D=0)\\
&=\mathbb{E}(Y|D=1) - \mathbb{E}(Y|D=0)
\end{align*}

- Then the ATE would be directly identified from the data 
 
(as would be the case for the other average treatment effects; they'd all be equal here)


---
# The evaluation problem (Cont'd)

- Direct identification of TE from the data is specific to .hi[mean TE's]

- Why? They only depend on the marginal distributions of $Y_0$ and $Y_1$

- Other features of the distribution of TE's depend on the joint distribution of $(Y_0,Y_1)$ 

    - e.g. variance, median

- Additional assumptions would be needed for identification of these


---
# The selection problem
 
- .hi[Major difficulty:] Agents often .hi[choose] to be treated based on characteristics which are related to their potential outcomes

- Canonical model of self-selection is due to `r Citet(biblio,"roy1951")`

- Within this framework, selection into treatment is directly based on the TE $Y_1-Y_0$

- Individuals self-select into treatment iff $Y_1-Y_0>0$

- In this case, $\mathbb{E}(Y_1|D=1) \neq \mathbb{E}(Y_1)$ and $\mathbb{E}(Y_0|D=0) \neq \mathbb{E}(Y_0)$


---
# The selection problem (Continued)

- The ATE cannot be identified directly from the observed average outcomes

- Need to know/assume more about selection rule to identify the TE parameters

- Two alternative approaches: point vs. partial identification

- Tradeoff strength/identifying power of the invoked assumptions


---
# Standard identifying assumptions
Three main alternative assumptions to deal with selection.

1. .hi[Unconfoundedness approach (Matching):] $(Y_0,Y_1) \perp D | X$, where $X$ is a set of observed covariates

2. .hi[IV approach:] $(Y_0,Y_1) \perp Z| X$, where $X$ and $Z$ denote two vectors of covariates affecting the potential outcomes and the treatment status, resp.

3. .hi[Control function approach:] $(Y_0,Y_1) \perp D| X,Z,\nu$ (where $\nu$ is an unobserved r.v.), plus some structure on the selection equation. 

(2) and (3) are related in the sense that both hinge on existence of exclusion restrictions


---
# Standard identifying assumptions (Cont'd)
Panel: most popular method to deal with selection is the difference-in-differences approach, which compares the evolution over time in the outcomes of treated vs. untreated individuals:

- $\Delta Y_0 \perp D$ (.hi[parallel trend assumption]), where $\Delta Y$ denotes the variation in the outcome $Y$ between $t_0$ and $t_1$, with the treatment taking place between $t_0$ and $t_1$ 

- Accounts for selection on .hi[time-invariant] characteristics 

- One may combine difference-in-differences with matching, which yields identification under weaker conditions `r Citep(biblio,"heckman_al1998")`


---
# Matching

- Accounts for selection on observables only

- Main identifying assumption: $(Y_0,Y_1) \perp D | X$

- This is known as the .hi[Conditional Independence Assumption] (CIA), or .hi[Unconfoundedness]

- Conditioning on a set of observed covariates $X$ randomizes treatment $D$

- Additional assumption: $\mathbb{P}(D=1|X=x) \in (0,1)$, for all $x$ in the support of $X$

- Required to be able to compare the outcomes of treated vs. untreated individuals, for any given value of characteristics $X=x$


---
# Matching (Cont'd)

-  Under these assumptions, the ATE is identified: 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Y_1-Y_0)&=\mathbb{E}(\mathbb{E}(Y_1-Y_0|X))\\
&=\mathbb{E}(\mathbb{E}(Y_1|D=1,X)) - \mathbb{E}(\mathbb{E}(Y_0|D=0,X))
\end{align*}

- Similar for the other average treatment effect parameters

- However, distributional TE's are not identified without additional restrictions

- Note that the CIA cannot be tested

- The second assumption, on the other hand, is directly testable


---
# IV
The IV approach also deals with selection on unobservables

Key identifying assumptions:

-  Exogeneity: $(Y_0,Y_1,(D(z))_z)\perp Z | X$
-  Relevance: $\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z)$ is a nondegenerate function of $Z$ given $X$

Exogenous variation in the instrument $Z$ (conditional on $X$) generates variation in $D$

Allows to identify the average treatment effect parameters ... under (strong) restrictions on selection into treatment

---
# IV (Cont'd)
Regression representation of the treatment effect model:
\begin{align*}
Y&=\alpha + \beta D + U
\end{align*}
where $\alpha=\mathbb{E}(Y_0)$, $\beta=Y_1-Y_0$ and $U=Y_0-\alpha$

- It is useful to consider two important cases:

- Homogeneous treatment effects ( $\beta$ constant)

- Heterogeneous treatment effects, with selection into treatment partly driven by the treatment effects 

- Sometimes referred to as a model with .hi[essential heterogeneity] `r Citep(biblio,"heckmanUrzuaVytlacil2006")`, aka the .hi[correlated random coefficient model]


---
# IV: homogeneous treatment effects
Unique treatment effect $(ATE=ATT=ATU=\beta)$

- We can apply standard IV method to the previous regression, which identifies the treatment effect $\beta_{\textrm{IV}} = \frac{Cov(Y,Z)}{Cov(D,Z)}$

- Special case of a binary instrument $Z$: Wald estimator

- But, assuming homogeneous treatment effects is very restrictive! 

- In practice, the effectiveness of social programs tends to vary a lot across individuals


---
# IV: heterogeneous treatment effects
.smaller[
The previous model is a correlated random coefficient model

- Key (negative) result: in general, the instrumental approach does not identify the ATE (nor any standard treatment effect parameters)

- Consider the previous model, where $\overline{\beta}$ is the ATE and $\eta \equiv \beta - \overline{\beta}$. We have:
\begin{align*}
Y&=\alpha + \overline{\beta} D + (U+\eta D)
\end{align*}

- In general, $Z$ is correlated with $\eta D$, and the IV does not identify the ATE $\overline{\beta}$

- The IV approach still works if selection into treatment is not driven by the idiosyncratic gains $\eta$, in which case:
\begin{align*}
Cov(Z,\eta D)&=\mathbb{E}(Z \eta D)\\
&=\mathbb{E}(ZD \mathbb{E}(\eta|Z,D))=0
\end{align*}
]


---
# IV and Local Average Treatment Effects (LATE)

- However, under an additional .hi[monotonicity] assumption, the IV identifies the LATE `r Citep(biblio,"imbensAngrist1994")`

- Monotonicity assumption ( $Z$ binary): $D_{Z=1} \geq D_{Z=0}$ 

- All individuals respond to a change in the instrument $Z$ in the same way (Only sufficient, `r Citep(biblio,"chaisemartin2017")`)

- Under the previous assumptions, we have: $$\widehat{\beta}_{IV} \overset{p}{\rightarrow} LATE=\mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0|D_{0}=0, D_1=1)$$

- Interpretation: ATE for the subset of individuals who would change their $D$ following a change in $Z$ (.hi[compliers])

```{r, echo=F, results=F}
# - Note that the margin, which depends on the instrument $Z$ considered, is not identified
```


---
# IV and Local Average Treatment Effects (Cont'd)

- In general, if heterogeneous treatment effects, $LATE \neq ATE$ (or $ATT$)

- Remark: when $Z$ takes more than two values, IV identifies a weighted average of the LATEs 

    - corresponding to a shift in $Z$ from $z$ to $z'$ 
    
    - for all $z$ and $z'$ in the support of $Z$ such that $\mathbb{P}(D=1|Z=z)<\mathbb{P}(D=1|Z=z')$

- See recent survey by `r Citet(biblio,"mogstadTorgovitsky2018")` 

    - discusses extrapolation of IV/LATE estimates to policy-relevant parameters


---
# Control function

- Key idea: use an explicit model of the relationship between $D$ and $(Y_0,Y_1)$ to correct for selection bias

- Main assumption: there exists a variable $\nu$ such that the following conditional independence condition holds:
$$(Y_0,Y_1) \perp D\,\vert\, X,Z,\nu$$

- And some structure is imposed on the selection equation 


---
# Control function (Cont'd)

- This is a fairly general framework

- Encompasses many treatment effects models 

    - perfect proxy for $\nu$ available to the econometrician 
    
    - $\nu$ observed with error as is the case for factor models
    
    - ...

- Important special case: seminal selection model of `r Citet(biblio,"heckman1979")`


---
# Control function (Cont'd)

- Assume a threshold crossing model for selection into treatment: $D=1\left[g(X,Z)-\nu>0\right]$

- And additively separable potential outcomes: $Y_k = \psi_k(X) + \varepsilon_k$, with $(\nu,\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_1) \perp (X,Z)$

- $\textrm{ATE}(X)=\psi_1(X) - \psi_0(X)$  

- $\psi_1(\cdot)$ is identified from:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Y_1|X,Z,D=1)&=\psi_1(X) + \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_1|X,Z,\nu<g(X,Z))
\end{align*}


---
# Control function (Cont'd)

- Under regularity conditions (absolute continuity and full support) on the distribution of $\nu$: $g(X,Z)=F^{-1}_{\nu}(\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z))$

- Thus, there exists a function $K_1(\cdot)$ (control function) such that:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Y_1|X,Z,D=1)&=\psi_1(X) + K_1(\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z))
\end{align*}

- This identifies $\psi_1(\cdot)$ .hi[up to location] as long as $X$ and $\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z)$ can vary in a sufficiently independent way 
    - measurable separability condition, `r Citep(biblio,c("florens_al1990","florens_al2008"))`

- But, the intercept is crucial to recover the treatment effect parameters!

---
# Control function (Cont'd)

- Solution: address the selection problem .hi[at the limit], using individuals with treatment probability $\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z)$ approaching 1 (0 for $\psi_0$) to identify the intercept `r Citep(biblio,"heckman1990")`

- For these individuals, $K_1(\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z))\longrightarrow 0$, and therefore: $\mathbb{E}(Y_1|X,Z,D=1)=\psi_1(X)$, which identifies the intercept.

- Key identifying assumption: $\textrm{Support}\left(\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z)\right) = [0,1]$ 

- Note that this is quite restrictive!


---
# Control function (Cont'd)

Also identifies the treatment effect on the treated and untreated since: 

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Y_1-Y_0|X,Z,D=1)&=\mathbb{E}(Y|X,Z,D=1) - \psi_0(X) - \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_0|X,Z,D=1)
\end{align*}

And it follows from the law of iterated expectations that (denoting by $p=\mathbb{P}(D=1|X,Z)$):

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_0|X,Z,D=1)&=-\frac{1-p}{p}K_{0}(p)
\end{align*}

---
# Control function (Cont'd)
 
-  Consistent estimators for $(\psi_0,\psi_1)$ up to location can be obtained 

    - e.g. semiparametric regression with linear outcomes `r Citep(biblio,"robinson1988")`

- `r Citet(biblio,"andrewsSchafgans1998")` provide a consistent estimator for the intercept 

    - smoothed version of `r Citet(biblio,"heckman1990")`

---
# Recent updates to difference-in-differences (DiD)
 
- The period 2018-22 saw a large and sudden increase in scrutiny of the basic difference-in-differences model

- `r Citet(biblio,"roth_al2022")` go through the main updates to the literature

- Discussion centers on two topics:

    1. Parallel trends assumption
    
    2. Whether the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator actual estimates the treatment parameter of interest (ATT)

- See also [this post](https://causalinf.substack.com/p/two-stage-did-and-taming-the-did) by Scott Cunningham discussing these issues
