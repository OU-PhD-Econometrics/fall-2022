# Plan for the Day

1. Discuss how to assess model fit

2. Model validation

3. Counterfactual simulations

4. Go through examples from a couple of recent papers

    - `r Citet(biblio,"fu_al2020")`

    - `r Citet(biblio,"langPalacios2018")`

# Steps to producing a "structural" estimation

- We discussed the structural workflow in our 3rd class meeting

- Since that class meeting, we've focused mainly on estimation

- We also briefly talked about identification

- But there are still some steps we haven't covered

- Counterfactuals are where you actually answer your research question

- And before counterfactuals you need to show your model fits the data


---
# Model Fit

- Model fit basically consists of showing that your model can match the data

- This is because the counterfactuals rely solely on the model

- Most model fit is _ad hoc_: you can choose what to show

- Typically, you'll want to show that moments of the $Y$ variables match

- e.g. choice frequencies in the data match choice probabilities of the model

- But there may be other moments of interest, like dynamic choice transitions


---
# Example from `r Citet(biblio,"fu_al2020")`

- In this paper, the authors show the following model fit statistics:

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
res <- tibble(
Variable = c('Ever arrested %','Always enrolled, 0 arrest %','GPA (standardized)','Retention %','Grade Completed by T'),
Data = c(5.6,72.2,-0.39,7.3,11.1),
Model = c(5.1,71.1,-0.43,8.0,11.2)
)
knitr::kable(head(res), format = 'html')
```

- These results are for youth with parents who are not well educated

- (This group is the most at risk to be arrested or drop out of school)

- Model fit for other groups is similar

---
# How to do model fit

There are a couple of options for producing model fit statistics

1. Use the model assumptions and estimates to simulate a new dataset

2. Use the data and estimates to compute $\hat{Y}$ and compare with $Y$

---
# Simulating a new dataset

- To simulate a new data set, you simply draw the unobservables from the model

- Use any initial conditions from the data

- Then (if the model is dynamic) simply draw $Y$ in $t=1$

- Then update the $X$'s in $t=2$ and draw $Y$ in $t=2$, ...

- If you used SMM to estimate the model, you should already have code for this

- Typically you want to repeat this process a few times

- This is because you don't want model fit to be subject to simulation error

---
# Assessing model fit from the data and estimates

- A simpler option is to predict the $\hat{Y}$ using the actual data

- This is identical to using a `predict()` function (like in PS6)

- However, this approach may not be possible in a model with key latent variables

- For example, unobserved types or other unobservables are not in the data

- In this case, you have no choice but to go the simulation route

---
# Model Validation

- Even if your model fits the data well, some may still be skeptical

- This is because, in most cases, you used your entire dataset in estimation

- If you do this, you open yourself up to the possibility of .hi[overfitting]

- .hi[Model validation] is a way of showing that your model is not overfit

- To do so, you show that the model reproduces key stats in a "holdout sample"

- This sample was "held out" of the estimation for purposes of validation

---
# Mini aside on machine learning

Machine learning is all about automating two hand-in-hand processes:

1. Model selection
    - What should the specification be?

2. Model validation
    - Does the model generalize to other (similar) contexts?

- The goal of machine learning is to automate these processes to maximize prediction

- This is different than the goal of econometrics (causal inference)

---
# Model selection

- In classical econometrics, we always select our models by hand

- This what the famed and sometimes maligned "robustness checks" address

- In machine learning, we let the computer tell us which specification is "best"

- "Best" is defined by minimizing both in- and out-of-sample prediction error

- This involves estimating many different specifications

- For complex models, automated model selection is computationally intensive

- `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")` did this by hand when exploring the shape of the cost function


---
# Model validation

- Broadly speaking, model validation is about whether the model "makes sense"

- It can be qualitative ("do the parameter results make sense? conform to theory?")

- It can also be quantitative ("is the prediction error sufficiently low?")

- In machine learning, .hi[cross-validation] is typically used

- Cross-validation informs about the optimal complexity of the model

- Then we (can) automate our specification search subject to that optimal complexity

- Automated specification search is still not commonly done in structural estimation

---
# How cross-validation works  `r Citep(biblio,"adams2018")`

.center[![cross-validation](CVdiagram.jpg)]

- Blue is the data that we use to estimate the model's parameters
- We randomly hold out $K$ portions of this data one-at-a-time (Green boxes)
- We assess the performance of the model in the Green data
- This tells us the optimal complexity (by "hyperparameters" if CV is automated)

---
# Validation in  `r Citet(biblio,"langPalacios2018")`

- A common question is how much unobserved heterogeneity to allow for

- This is not _ex ante_ knowable

- Typical approach is to put "enough" in there such that the in-sample fit is good

- `r Citet(biblio,"langPalacios2018")` search for optimal number of types

- Use a 20% holdout sample to assess the out-of-sample fit

- Note that they do not do cross-validation

- They simply compare how the model fits in the estimation and holdout data


---
# Validation in  `r Citet(biblio,"delavandeZafar2019")`

- Another form of validation could be to predict treatment effects in control group

- If the model is good, it should be able to do this

- `r Citet(biblio,"delavandeZafar2019")` do something similar to this

- Rather than comparing model predictions in/out of sample,

- They compare them for a different state of the world

- In their case, the new state of the world is one without schooling costs

- They can do this because they elicited preferences for schooling under both regimes

- But they only used one regime when estimating their model

---
# Counterfactuals

- Counterfactuals involve changing the model, simulating new data and then comparing w/status quo

- "Changing a policy" typically can be captured by changing the value of a set of parameters

- "Policy experiments" typically mimic some real-world policy in this way

- .hi[Note:] policy experiments always assume invariance of the other model parameters!

- So if I change the value of one parameter, that won't "leak" into any others

- This may be a heroic assumption, depending on the model

---
# Examples of counterfactuals

.smaller[
- `r Citet(biblio,"fu_al2020")`
    - Would low-SES youth commit fewer crimes if we sent them to better schools?
    
- `r Citet(biblio,"arcidiacono_al2016")`
    - How would human capital investment change if there were perfect information?
    
- `r Citet(biblio,"akr_legacy2022")`
    - Would Harvard become less white if it were to eliminate legacy admissions?
    
- `r Citet(biblio,"ransom2022")`
    - Would American workers move to a new city if they were paid $10,000 to do so?
    
- `r Citet(biblio,"caucutt_al2020")`
    - What can reduce disparities in child investment across rich/poor families?

# How to do counterfactuals

- To perform the counterfactual simulations, follow these steps:

    - Impose parameter restrictions
    
    - Simulate fake data under those restrictions
    
    - Compare the resulting model summary to a "baseline" prediction
    
    - (The baseline prediction is your model fit)
    
- As you can see, if you use SMM, you've already got the code to simulate the model

# Discussion of model fit counterfactuals

- Model fit is good, and I would have expected even better

- MLE is designed to match the data choice frequencies

- The counterfactuals make sense

- Removing preference for earnings leads to re-sorting of occupations

- Sorting into low-wage occupations and out of high-wage ones

---
# Confidence intervals around counterfactuals

- The counterfactuals above give us a new predicted occupational distribution

- But we don't know what the confidence intervals are around the prediction

- Our estimates inherently come with sampling variation

- We should incorporate that variation into our counterfactual

- How do we do this? Bootstrapping

---
# Bootstrapping to get CIs around counterfactuals

- Recall: $-H^{-1}$ is the variance matrix of our estimates, where $H$ is the Hessian

- Assume that $\hat{\theta} \sim MVN(\theta,-H^{-1})$

    - but remember that we want to minimize $-\ell$ so we just use $H^{-1}$

- We sample from this distribution $B$ times and compute our new counterfactuals

- Then we can look at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles

- This will represent a 95% confidence interval

- This algorithm is known as the .hi[parametric bootstrap]

- Cf. .hi[nonparametric bootstrap] which is when we randomly re-sample from our data

---
# Coding example: parametric bootstrap

- Here's how we can get the confidence interval around the policy effect
