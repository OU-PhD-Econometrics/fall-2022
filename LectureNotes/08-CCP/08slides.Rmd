# Plan for the Day

1. Show the relationship between differences in conditional value functions and conditional choice probabilities

2. Show how conditional choice probabilities are helpful in estimating problems with terminal choices

3. Show how to estimate the Rust bus engine problem such that the computational time is less than two minutes

# `r Citet(biblio,"hotzMiller1993")`

- Dynamic discrete choice models are complicated to estimate because of the future value terms

- `r Citet(biblio,"hotzMiller1993")` show:

- Differences in conditional value functions $v_j-v_{j'}$ can be mapped into .hi[conditional choice probabilities] ( $p_j$'s )

- We can pull the $p_j$'s from the data in a first stage

- Empirical example: optimal stopping with respect to couples' fertility

---
# Difference in $v$'s and logit errors

- Consider an individual who faces two choices where the errors are T1EV 

- The probability of choice 1 is:
\begin{align*}
p_1&=\frac{\exp(v_1)}{\exp(v_0)+\exp(v_1)}
\end{align*}

- The ratio of $p_1/p_0$ is then:
\begin{align*}
\frac{p_1}{p_0}&=\frac{\exp(v_1)}{\exp(v_0)} = \exp(v_1 - v_0)
\end{align*}
implying that:
\begin{align*}
\ln(p_1/p_0)&=v_1-v_0
\end{align*}

`r #solve for v_0-v1 as a function of p_1 and p_0`
`r #emphasize that we could do this with p_0 as well`

---
# General structure

- The inversion theorem of Hotz and Miller says that there exists a mapping, $\psi$, from the conditional choice probabilities, the $p$'s, into the differences in the conditional valuation functions, $v_j-v_k$:
\begin{align*}
V_{t+1}&=v_{0t+1}+\mathbb{E}\max\{\epsilon_{0t+1},v_{1t+1}+\epsilon_{1t+1}-v_{0t+1},...,\\
&\phantom{\text{-------------------------------}}v_{{J}t+1}+\epsilon_{{J}t+1}-v_{0t+1}\}\\
V_{t+1}&=v_{0t+1}+\mathbb{E}\max\{\epsilon_{0t+1},\psi_0^1(p_{t+1})+\epsilon_{1t+1},...,\psi_0^{{J}}(p_{t+1})+\epsilon_{{J}t+1}\}
\end{align*}

The $p$'s can be taken from the data.  However:

1. We need the mapping, $\psi$,
2. We need to be able to calculate the expectations of the $\epsilon$'s
3. We need to do something with the $v_0$'s

---
# Terminal choices

Consider the conditional value function $v_{1t}$:

\begin{align*}
v_{1t}(x_t)&=u_1(x_t)+\beta\sum_{x_{t+1}}V_{t+1}(x_{t+1})f_1(x_{t+1}|x_t)\\
&=u_1(x_t)+\beta\sum_{x_{t+1}}\Big[v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})+\\
&\phantom{\text{----}}\mathbb{E}\max\{\epsilon_{0t+1},\psi_0^1(p_{t+1})+\epsilon_{1t+1}\}\Big]f_1(x_{t+1}|x_t)
\end{align*}

- If $v_{0t+1}=X_{t+1}\alpha_0$, then .hi[we don't need to solve a backwards recursion problem] 

- ... so long as we can deal with the last line


---
# Terminal choices and logit errors

- When the $\epsilon$'s are Type I extreme value, $V_{t+1}$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
V_{t+1}(x_{t+1})&=\ln\left[\exp(v_0(x_{t+1}))+\exp(v_1(x_{t+1}))\right]+c
\end{align*}

- We can then express the conditional value function as:
\begin{align*}
v_{1t}(x_t)&=u_1(x_t)+\beta\bigg(v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})+\\
&\phantom{\text{----}}\ln\left\{1+\exp[v_{1t+1}(x_{t+1})-v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})]\right\}\bigg)+\beta c
\end{align*}
which can now be written as a function of the conditional choice probabilities:
\begin{align*}
v_{1t}(x_t)&=u_1(x_t)+\beta\bigg(v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})-\ln\left[p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})\right]\bigg)+\beta c
\end{align*}

---
# Terminal choices and logit errors 2

- In general, $v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})$ will still be recursive: it has $V_{t+2}$ in it

- But if choice 0 is terminal, we'll have something linear for $v_{0t+1}$ (i.e. no $V_{t+2}$)

- We can then use the data to calculate $p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})$ (e.g. a bin estimator)

- Note that this is similar to getting the $f_j(x_{t+1}|x_t)$'s in a first stage

- Things just about reduce down to a simple logit!

---
# Derivation

- The key idea is that $V_{t+1} = v_{jt+1} - \ln p_{jt+1} + c$ when the $\epsilon$'s are T1EV

- The derivation trick is to multiply and divide the inside of the log sum by $\exp(v_{jt+1})$:
.smallest[
\begin{align*}
V_{t+1}(x_{t+1})&=\ln\left[\sum_k\exp(v_k(x_{t+1}))\right]+c\\
&=\ln\left[\frac{\exp(v_j(x_{t+1}))}{\exp(v_j(x_{t+1}))}\sum_k\exp(v_k(x_{t+1}))\right]+c\\
&=\ln\left[\exp(v_j(x_{t+1}))\frac{\sum_k\exp(v_k(x_{t+1}))}{\exp(v_j(x_{t+1}))}\right]+c\\
&=\underbrace{\ln\exp(v_j(x_{t+1}))}_{v_j(x_{t+1})}+\ln\left[\underbrace{\frac{\sum_k\exp(v_k(x_{t+1}))}{\exp(v_j(x_{t+1}))}}_{p_j(x_{t+1})^{-1}}\right]+c\\
&=v_j(x_{t+1}) - \ln p_j(x_{t+1}) + c \,\,\,\, \forall\,\, j\in J
\end{align*}
]

# Derivation for GEV

- If the $\epsilon$'s are GEV, we can still express $V_{t+1}$ as a closed-form function of $p_{jt+1}$

- But the math gets more complicated because it depends on the form of $G$

- Recall: $V_{t+1} = \ln G$, where $G = \sum_k \exp(\cdot)$ if $\epsilon$'s are T1EV

- For nested logit, the formula will involve the nesting parameters (the $\lambda$'s)

- If the $\epsilon$'s are Normal, there is no closed-form expression for $V_{t+1}$

    - You would need to use simulation to compute the $\mathbb{E}\max$ integral

- The only paper I've seen use CCP's with GEV is `r Citet(biblio,"coateMangum2019")`

# Another way of looking at the problem
- We can also write $V_{t+1}$ as
\begin{align*}
V_{t+1}(x_{t+1})&=v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})+\\
&\phantom{\text{----}}\sum_{j=0}^1p_{jt+1}(x_{t+1})\bigg[v_{1t+1}(x_{t+1})-v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})+\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_{jt+1}|d_{jt+1},x_{t+1})\bigg]\\
&=v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})+\\
&\phantom{\text{----}}\sum_{j=0}^1p_{jt+1}(x_{t+1})\bigg[\ln\left(\frac{p_{1t+1}(x_{t+1})}{p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})}\right)+\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_{jt+1}|d_{jt+1},x_{t+1})\bigg]
\end{align*}

- `r Citet(biblio,"hotzMiller1993")` eq. (4.12) shows that
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_{jt+1}|d_{jt+1},x_{t+1}) = c - \ln[p_{jt+1}]
\end{align*}


---
# Another way of looking at the problem
- So it is possible to write $V_{t+1}$ in terms of $v_0$ and a bunch of probabilities:
\begin{align*}
V_{t+1}(x_{t+1})&=v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})+\\
&\phantom{\text{----}}\sum_{j=0}^1p_{jt+1}(x_{t+1})\bigg[\ln\left(\frac{p_{1t+1}(x_{t+1})}{p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})}\right)-\ln\left(p_{jt+1}(x_{t+1})\right)\bigg] + c
\end{align*}

- This is the preferred notation of `r Citet(biblio,"hotzMiller1993")`

---
# `r Citet(biblio,"hotzMiller1993")`, p. 505, eq. (4.13)

- $j=1$ means not sterilizing; $j=2$ means sterilizing

- $j=2$ is terminal, meaning that $v_{2t} =$ some number (no more $\epsilon$'s)

- Suppose a couple does not sterilize

- Then there is some probability $\alpha$ of having a child in the next period

- Conditional on having a child, the terms in eq. (4.13) that have CCPs are:

\begin{align*}
&\phantom{\text{----}}\left\{\sum_{j=1}^2p_j(H_t,1)\left(c-\ln\left[p_j(H_t,1)\right]\right)\right\}+p_1(H_t,1)\ln\left[\frac{p_1(H_t,1)}{p_2(H_t,1)}\right]
\end{align*}

- Other terms in (4.13) are the $v_{2t}$ formula or integrating over the $f$'s

---
# Renewal

- An action is termed .hi[renewal] if by, taking the action, the effect of the previous choices on the state are irrelevant
\begin{align*}
\sum_{x_{t+1}}f_0(x_{t+2}|x_{t+1})f_j(x_{t+1}|x_{t})&=\sum_{x_{t+1}}f_0(x_{t+2}|x_{t+1})f_{j'}(x_{t+1}|x_{t}) \qquad \textrm{for all } \{j,j'\}
\end{align*}

---
# Renewal 2

- Normalizing the future value term relative to the renewal action  for choice 1 yields:
\begin{align*}
v_{1t}(x_{t})&=u_1(x_t)+\beta\sum_{x_{t+1}}\left[v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})-\ln(p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1}))\right]f_1(x_{t+1}|x_t)+\beta c
\end{align*}

- Now substitute in for $v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})$ with:
\begin{align*}
v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})&=u_0(x_{t+1})+\beta\sum_{x_{t+2}}V_{t+2}(x_{t+2})f_0(x_{t+2}|x_{t+1})
\end{align*}

- The term involving $V_{t+2}(x_{t+2})$ is then:
\begin{align*}
\beta^2\sum_{x_{t+1}}\sum_{x_{t+2}}V_{t+2}(x_{t+2})f_0(x_{t+2}|x_{t+1})f_1(x_{t+1}|x_t)
\end{align*}


---
# Renewal 3

- Recall that in estimation we work with _differenced_ conditional value functions 

- Now consider $v_{0t}(x_t)$ and again normalize the FV term relative to choice 0:
\begin{align*}
v_{0t}(x_{t})&=u_0(x_t)+\beta\sum_{x_{t+1}}\left[v_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})-\ln(p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1}))\right]f_0(x_{t+1}|x_t)+\\
&\phantom{\text{----}}\beta^2\sum_{x_{t+1}}\sum_{x_{t+2}}V_{t+2}(x_{t+2})f_0(x_{t+2}|x_{t+1})f_0(x_{t+1}|x_t)+\beta c
\end{align*}

- The renewal property implies that the $V_{t+2}(x_{t+2})$ terms are the same, and will .hi[cancel out] once we take differences:

.smallest[
\begin{align*}
v_{1t}(x_{t})-v_{0t}(x_{t})&=u_1(x_t) - u_0(x_t)+\beta\sum_{x_{t+1}}\left[u_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})-\ln(p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1}))\right]f_1(x_{t+1}|x_t)-\\
&\phantom{\text{--- --- --- --- --- --- --- -}}\beta\sum_{x_{t+1}}\left[u_{0t+1}(x_{t+1})-\ln(p_{0t+1}(x_{t+1}))\right]f_0(x_{t+1}|x_t)\\
\end{align*}
]

# Back to `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")`

- `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")` has two choices with the following flow payoffs:

\begin{align*}
u(x_t,d_t,\theta)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}-c(x_t,\theta)&\textrm{if }d_t=0\\-[\overline{P}-\underline{P}+c(0,\theta)]&\textrm{if } d_t=1\end{array}\right.
\end{align*}

- The value of replacing the engine at $t+1$ then does not depend upon whether the engine was replaced at $t$ 

- This implies that we only need the one-period-ahead probability of replacement for the future utility component


---
# `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")` with CCP's

\begin{align*}
v_1(x)&=u_1(x)+\beta\left[v_1(0)-\ln(p_1(0))\right]+\beta c\\
v_0(x)&=u_0(x)+\beta\sum_{x'}\left[v_1(x')-\ln(p_1(x'))\right]f(x'|x)+\beta c
\end{align*}

- In this case $v_1(0)$ and $v_1(x')$ are the same

- Taking differences yields:

\begin{align*}
v_1(x)-v_0(x)&=u_1(x)-u_0(x)+\beta\left[\sum_{x'}\left(\ln[p_1(x)]-\ln[p_1(0)]\right)f(x'|x)\right]
\end{align*}

- Estimation is then as simple as a logit with an adjustment term, with the calculation of the $p_1$'s and $f(x'|x)$ in a first stage

---

# CCP's with finite mixture distributions

- `r Citet(biblio,"arcidiaconoMiller2011")` show how to use CCPs with unobserved heterogeneity

- They show that you can adjust the `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")` model to incorporate unobservable bus attributes

- The model still estimates quickly due to additive separability in the model components `r Citep(biblio,"arcidiaconoJones2002")` 


---

# CCP's with actions that are not terminal or renewal

- `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")` provides an example of a renewal action

- `r Citet(biblio,"hotzMiller1993")` shows an example of a terminal action

- We can still use CCP's even if no such actions exist in our model

- The main difference is that we will need additional CCPs than just $\ln p_{0t+1}$

- Through a property known as .hi[finite dependence] we can achieve cancellation after at most 3 periods (depending on the model)

- Recent examples:
    - `r Citet(biblio,"arcidiacono_al2016")` – see equation (29)
    - `r Citet(biblio,"ransom2022")` – see equation (A.14) and Figures A4 and A5

---

# Counterfactuals and CCP's

- The main rub with CCPs is that they don't simplify counterfactual simulations

- Why? Because we don't observe $\ln p_{0t+1}$ in the counterfactual world

- If we could, we probably wouldn't need a structural model to begin with 

- So we still must do a backwards recursion computation to get counterfactuals

- Or restrict ourselves to short-run counterfactuals
