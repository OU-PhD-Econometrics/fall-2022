# Preference Heterogeneity

- So far, we have only looked at models where all agents have identical preferences

- Mathematically, $\beta_{RedBus}$ does not vary across agents
    - Implies everyone has same price elasticity, etc.

- But in real life, we know people have different values, interests, and preferences

- Failure to account for this heterogeneity will result in a misleading model

- e.g. lowering a product's price likely won't induce purchasing from some customers



---
# Observable preference heterogeneity

- One solution to the homogeneity problem is to add interaction terms

- Suppose we have a 2-option transportation model:
\begin{align*}
u_{i,bus}&=\beta_1 X_i + \gamma Z_1\\
u_{i,car}&=\beta_2 X_i + \gamma Z_2
\end{align*}

- We could introduce heterogeneity in $\gamma$ by interacting $Z_j$ with $X_i$:
\begin{align*}
u_{i,bus}&=\beta_1 X_i + \widetilde{\gamma} Z_1 X_i\\
u_{i,car}&=\beta_2 X_i + \widetilde{\gamma} Z_2 X_i
\end{align*}

- Now a change in $Z_j$ will have a heterogeneous impact on utility depending on $X_i$

- e.g. those w/diff. income $(X_i)$ may be more/less sensitive to changes in price $(Z_j)$




---
# Unobservable preference heterogeneity

- Observable preference heterogeneity can be useful

- But many dimensions of preferences are likely unobserved

- In this case, we need to "interact" $Z$ with something unobserved

- One way to do this is to assume that $\beta$ or $\gamma$ varies across people

- Assume some distribution (e.g. Normal), called the .hi[mixing distribution]

- Then integrate this out of the likelihood function


---
# Mixed Logit likelihood function

- Assume, e.g. $\gamma_i \sim F$ with pdf $f$ and distributional parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$

- Then the logit choice probabilities become
.smaller[
\begin{align*}
P_{ij}\left(X,Z;\beta,\mu,\sigma\right)&= \int\frac{\exp\left(X_{i}\left(\beta_{j}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma_i\left(Z_{ij}-Z_{iJ}\right)\right)}{\sum_k \exp\left(X_{i}\left(\beta_{k}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma_i\left(Z_{ik}-Z_{iJ}\right)\right)}f\left(\gamma_i;\mu,\sigma\right)d\gamma_i
\end{align*}
]

- Note: this is just like the expected value of a function of a random variable $W$:
.smaller[
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[g(W)]&= \int g(W) f\left(W;\mu,\sigma\right)dW
\end{align*}
]

- Annoyance: the log likelihood now has an integral inside the log!
.smaller[
\begin{align*}
\ell\left(X,Z;\beta,\gamma,\mu,\sigma\right)&=\sum_{i=1}^N \log\left\{\int\prod_{j}\left[\frac{\exp\left(X_{i}\left(\beta_{j}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma\left(Z_{ij}-Z_{iJ}\right)\right)}{\sum_k \exp\left(X_{i}\left(\beta_{k}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma\left(Z_{ik}-Z_{iJ}\right)\right)}\right]^{d_{ij}}f\left(\gamma;\mu,\sigma\right)d\gamma\right\}
\end{align*}
]

# Common mixing distributions

- Normal

- Log-normal

- Uniform

- Triangular

- Can also go crazy and specify a multivariate normal

    - This would allow, e.g. heterogeneity in $\gamma$ to be correlated with $\beta$





---
# Mixed Logit estimation

- With the integral inside the log, estimation of the mixed logit is intensive

- To estimate the likelihood function, need to numerically approximate the integral

- The most common way of doing this is .hi[quadrature]

- Another common way of doing this is by .hi[simulation] (Monte Carlo integration)

- I'll walk you through how to do this in this week's problem set

---

# Finite Mixture Distributions

- Another option to mixed logit is to assume the mixing distribution is discrete

- We assume we have missing variable that has finite support and is independent from the other variables 

- Let $\pi_s$ denote the probability of being in the $s$th unobserved group

- Integrating out over the unobserved groups then yields the following log likelihood:
\begin{align*}
\ell\left(X,Z;\beta,\gamma,\pi\right)=&\sum_{i=1}^N \log\left\{\sum_{s}\pi_s\prod_{j}\left[\frac{\exp\left(X_{i}\left(\beta_{j}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma_{s}\left(Z_{ij}-Z_{iJ}\right)\right)}{\sum_k \exp\left(X_{i}\left(\beta_{k}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma_{s}\left(Z_{ik}-Z_{iJ}\right)\right)}\right]^{d_{ij}}\right\}\\
\end{align*}

---

# Mixture Distributions and Panel Data

- With panel data, mixture dist. allows for .hi[permanent unobserved heterogeneity]

- Here the unobs. variable is fixed over time and indep. of the covariates at $t=1$

- The log likelihood function for the finite mixture case is then:
\begin{align*}
\ell\left(X,Z;\beta,\gamma,\pi\right)=&\sum_{i=1}^N \log\left\{\sum_{s}\pi_s\prod_{t}\prod_{j}\left[\frac{\exp\left(X_{it}\left(\beta_{j}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma_{s}\left(Z_{ijt}-Z_{iJt}\right)\right)}{\sum_k \exp\left(X_{it}\left(\beta_{k}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma_{s}\left(Z_{ikt}-Z_{iJt}\right)\right)}\right]^{d_{ijt}}\right\}
\end{align*}

- And for the mixed logit case is:
.smaller[
\begin{align*}
\ell\left(X,Z;\beta,\gamma,\mu,\sigma\right)=&\sum_{i=1}^N \log\left\{\int\prod_{t}\prod_{j}\left[\frac{\exp\left(X_{it}\left(\beta_{j}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma\left(Z_{ijt}-Z_{iJt}\right)\right)}{\sum_k \exp\left(X_{it}\left(\beta_{k}-\beta_{J}\right)+\gamma\left(Z_{ikt}-Z_{iJt}\right)\right)}\right]^{d_{ijt}}f\left(\gamma;\mu,\sigma\right)d\gamma\right\}\\
\end{align*}

# Dynamic Selection

- Often, we want to link the choices to other outcomes:
    - labor force participation and earnings

    - market entry and profits

- If individuals choose to participate in the labor market based upon unobserved wages, our estimates of the returns to participating will be biased  

- Mixture distributions provide an alternative way of controlling for selection

- .hi[Assumption:] no selection problem once we control for the unobserved variable

---

# Dynamic Selection

- Let $Y_{1t}$ denote the choice and $Y_{2t}$ denote the outcome

-  The assumption on the previous slide means the joint likelihood is separable:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(Y_{1t},Y_{2t}|X_{1t},X_{2t},\alpha_1,\alpha_2,s)&=\mathcal{L}(Y_{1t}|Y_{2t},X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)\mathcal{L}(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,s)\\
&=\mathcal{L}(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)\mathcal{L}(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,s)
\end{align*}
where $s$ is the unobserved type

---

# Estimation in Stages

- Suppose $s$ was observed  

- There'd be no selection problem as long as we could condition on $s$ and $X_{1t}$  

- The log likelihood function is:
\begin{align*}
\ell=&\sum_{i}\sum_t \ell_1(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)+\ell_2(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,s)
\end{align*}

- Estimation could proceed in stages:

1. Estimate $\alpha_2$ using only $\ell_2$
2. Taking the estimate of $\alpha_2$ as given, estimate $\alpha_1$ using $\ell_1$

---

# Non-separable means no stages

- When $s$ is unobserved, however, the log likelihood function is not additively separable:
\begin{align*}
\ell=&\sum_i\log\left(\sum_s\pi_s\prod_t\mathcal{L}(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)\mathcal{L}(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,s)\right)
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal{L}$ is a likelihood function

- Makes sense: if there is a selection problem, we can't estimate one part of the problem without considering what is happening in the other part

---

# The EM Algorithm

- We can get additive separability of the finite mixture model with the .hi[EM algorithm]

- EM stands for "Expectation-Maximization"

- The algorithm iterates on two steps:
   - E-step: estimate parameters having to do with the mixing distribution (i.e. the $\pi$'s)
   
   - M-step: pretend you observe the unobserved variable and estimate

- The EM algorithm is used in other applications to fill in missing data

- In this case, the missing data is the permanent unobserved heterogeneity

---

# The EM Algorithm (Continued)

- With the EM algorithm, the non-separable likelihood function
\begin{align*}
\ell=&\sum_i\log\left(\sum_s\pi_s\prod_t\mathcal{L}(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)\mathcal{L}(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,s)\right)
\end{align*}
can be written in a form that is separable:
\begin{align*}
\ell=&\sum_i\sum_s q_{is}\sum_t\ell_1\left(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s\right)+\ell_2\left(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,s)\right)
\end{align*}
where $q_{is}$ is the probability that $i$ belongs to group $s$

- $q_{is}$ satisfies $\pi_s = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}q_{is}$

---

# Estimation in stages again

- We can now estimate the model in stages because of the restoration of separability

- The only twist is that we need to .hi[weight] by the $q$'s in each estimation stage

- Stage 1 of M-step: estimate $\ell(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)$ weighting by the $q$'s

- Stage 2 of M-step: estimate $\ell(Y_{2t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)$ weighting by the $q$'s

- E-step: update the $q$'s by calculating
\begin{align*}
q_{is}=&\frac{\pi_s\prod_t\mathcal{L}(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,s)\mathcal{L}(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,s)}{\sum_m\pi_m\prod_t\mathcal{L}(Y_{1t}|X_{1t},\alpha_1,m)\mathcal{L}(Y_{2t}|X_{2t},\alpha_2,m)}
\end{align*}

- Iterate on E and M steps until the $q$'s converge `r Citep(biblio,"arcidiaconoJones2002")`

# Other notes on estimation in stages

- With permanent unobserved heterogeneity, we no longer have .hi[global concavity]

- This means that if we provide different starting values, we'll get different estimates

- Another thing to note is .hi[standard errors]

- With stages, each stage introduces estimation error into the following stages

    - i.e. we take the estimate as given, but it actually is subject to sampling error

- The easiest way to resolve this is with bootstrapping

- Both of these issues (local optima and estimation error) are problem-specific

- You need to understand your specific case

---

# To Recap

- Why are we doing all of this difficult work?

- Because preference heterogeneity allows for a more credible structural model

    - e.g. `r Citet(biblio,"gillingham_al_jpe")`

- But introducing preference heterogeneity can make the model intractible

- Discretizing the distribution of heterogeneity and using the EM algorithm can help

- We also need to be mindful of how to compute standard errors of the estimates

- As well as be aware that the objective function is likely no longer globally concave
